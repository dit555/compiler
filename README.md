# compiler
A compiler for a made up languge (MIN-L). Incomplete and does not work with more advanced programs. Phase 3 is where things don't go well. I underestimated the amount of time to solve this part and started too late. In addition, halfway through my implementation of phase 3 I realize that my implementation method is flawed. I learned a lot about time managment from this project. I probably won't update of fix this.
## phase 1:
flex parser
## phase 2:
bison CFG implementation
## phase 3:
code generation using bison CFG
